# 🔥 Forest Fires in Brazil: Exploratory Data Analysis (1998–2017)
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of forest fire incidents across Brazil over a 20-year period. By examining temporal and regional patterns, the analysis aims to uncover insights that could inform environmental policies and fire prevention strategies.

# 📊 Overview
The analysis focuses on understanding:

- Trends in forest fire occurrences over time

- Regional distribution of fires across Brazilian states

- Seasonal patterns and peak fire periods

- Potential correlations with environmental factors (if additional data is incorporated)

# 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is the Forest Fires in Brazil dataset available on Kaggle. It comprises records of forest fires in Brazil, categorized by state and year, spanning from 1998 to 2017. Each record includes the number of fires reported in a particular state for a given year.
